        I'm a junior front-end developer. I like React, Node.js and I learn
        Three.js. Soon I want lern TypeScript as well. I speak Spanish fluently
        and English good. I come from Poland and therefore I speak fluently
        Polish. I was a teacher, I work very well with people. I learn new
        skills quickly. I was also an editor of books, the basics of UX/UI are
        no strangers to me. I also like to draw. I know the basics of vector
        graphics and photo processing. I would like to acquire knowledge and
        experience working alongside the best programmers.
